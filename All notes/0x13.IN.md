# IN

Lets say we want to select everyone from China, France and Brazil.

We can select with this command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth = 'China' OR country_of_birth = 'France' OR country_of_birth = 'Brazil';
```

We will get everyone from China, Brazil and France.

- However this is a lot of code to include 3 data types, there is duplication of `country_of_birth`.

To improve this, we use the `IN` keyword.

### IN

- It takes a list of values, then returns a query matching those values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth IN ('China', 'France', 'Brazil');
```

It will work the same.

It also makes it easy to add other countries.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth IN ('China', 'France', 'Brazil', 'Kenya') ORDER BY country_of_birth;
```
