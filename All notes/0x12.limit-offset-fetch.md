# LIMIT, OFFSET AND FETCH

lets say we want to select the very first 10 rows from our table.

we use:

## LIMIT

Used to limit the amount of data returned by the SELECT statement. For example selecting only the first 10 records.
The basic syntax is as follows

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name LIMIT number_of_rows;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;
```

We will have the record of the first 10 people in that table.

## OFFSET

The OFFSET clause is used to skip a specified number of rows before starting to return rows from the result set.

It is typically used in combination with LIMIT or FETCH to paginate results, allowing you to retrieve data in chunks or skip over parts of the dataset.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table OFFSET number_of_rows_to_skip;
```

- Selecting a record of a certain number of people after a certain limit.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5;
```

- It will generate records after 5 rows, the first 5. That is 6-10.

We can remove the limit, to select up to the last record.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5;
```

## FETCH

`LIMIT` - is not a keyword by SQL standards.

- We use the fetch keyword.

Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name
FETCH {FIRST | NEXT} row_count {ROW | ROWS} ONLY;
```

example

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;
```

It will display from row 6, 5 rows, that will be 6-10.

For 1 row you can write `FIRST 1 ROW` or `FIRST ROW`.
