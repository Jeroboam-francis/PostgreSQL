# LIMIT, OFFSET AND FETCH

lets say we want to select the very first 10 rows from our table.

we use:

## LIMIT

```sql
SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;
```

We will have the record of the first 10 people in that table.

## OFFSET

- Selecting a record of a certain number of people after a certain limit.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5;
```

- It will generate records after 5 rows, the first 5. That is 6-10.

We can remove the limit, to select up to the last record.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5;
```

## FETCH

`LIMIT` - is not a keyword by SQL standards.

- We use the fetch keyword.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;
```

It will display from row 6, 5 rows, that will be 6-10.

For 1 row you can write `FIRST 1 ROW` or `FIRST ROW`.
