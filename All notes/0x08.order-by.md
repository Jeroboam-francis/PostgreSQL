# ORDER BY

- To sort out data. Either ascending or descending by column.
- Works for numbers, dates and strings.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth ACS;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
```

You can also sort with more than one value:

```sql
SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY id, email;
```

- It is recommended to sort data using column.

- bY default, the above will be sorted in ascending, you can include it or not `(ACS)`.
