# How to Create and Connect to a DataBase.

## Creating a DataBase

- quit command - `/q`

In SQL Shell, if you created a local database, quit out of it. `/q`

Then type `psql`, it will take you to a mode that you will see you are using psql, its version and how to find help.

When you type `help` you are going to get some help.

- You will notice that most of the commands start with a back-slash `\`.

- To get more help, type `\?`.

- `\l` lists all the databases that we have.

To create a fresh database, we use the command `CREATE DATABASE`, you can use any case, but uppercase if the best database way.

- then give it a name, and end it with a semi-colon, otherwise it wont execute the command.

> CREATE DATABASE test;

When you view the list of all databases, `\l`, you will see the database that we have created.

## Connecting to a Database

There are 2 ways

1. use the command `psql --help`.

- You will see a bunch of help. Scroll down to `connection options`.

When you're inside the shell, commands like `psql --help` or `psql --version` won't work because they are meant to be run from your system's terminal (not inside PostgreSQL).

## If the Command does not work on the terminal.

Do this:

- Go to C/Program Files/PostgreSQL/bin

If you see a folder with a version, it means it is installed. eg: `17`.

Replace `17` with your version.

## Now we need to add PostgreSQl to the system path.

Do this:
Inside bin, run `Win + R` then type `sysdm.cpl`, press enter.

- Click the `Advanced Tab` then `Environment Variables` , under `System   Variables` find `Path` and click `Edit `.

- Click `New` and paste `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin`,then OK, OK, OK.

It should work now.

Now lets continue with connecting to a database.

- `-h localhost` The host is localhost, but if connected to a remote server you type actual ip address.

- `p 5432` - the port, by default it is `5432`.

- `-U username` provide the username.
- Then specify the actual database name, we had created a database called `test`.

> Follow the earlier step the `\l` to see the list of databases.

- Then run `\c test` to connect to the database.

> You are now connected to database "test" as user "postgres".

To switch to another database run `\c database_name` to switch between databases.
