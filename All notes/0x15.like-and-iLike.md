# LIKE AND ILIKE

## LIKE

Like operators is used to match text values against a pattern using wild-cards.

Lets say for our list of emails, we want to find each email that ends with `.com`.

`%` - `the wildcard`, it means any character.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%.com';
```

It will display all emails ending in `.com`.

Lets say that we want to find if there is anyone with `@arizona.edu`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%@arizona.edu';
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%@google.com';
```

Lets look for an instance where google has employees from various locations.

We can remove the `.com` and use a wildcard `%`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '%@google.%';
```

1. Instead of using the actual wildcard `%`, we can use an underscore `_`.

- `_` means this has to match single characters.

for instance `_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ` 8 underscores together match 8 characters.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '________@%';
```

The emails that will be shown will begin with 8 characters.

Lets say that we want to find any person that has at least 3 characters. Maybe followed by `o` then `@%` @ anything.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE '___o@%';
```

- You might or not find an email with that patters.

Lets say that we want to find any country that starts with `p`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth LIKE 'p%';
```

- we will get none.

Lets go ahead and put an uppercase `P`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth LIKE 'P%';
```

We will now get a list of countries that begin with `P`.

### LIKE is case sensitive.

## ILIKE

### ILIKE is not case sensitive.

```sql
SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth ILIKE 'p%';
```

- This will give a result of countries starting with letter `p`.
