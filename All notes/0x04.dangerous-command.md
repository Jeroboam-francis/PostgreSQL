# A dangerous Command.

We created a database called `test`.

- Lets say you want to delete it.

- To create a database: `CREATE DATABASE test;`

- To delete a database: `DROP DATABASE test;`

End with a semi-colon for the command to execute.

All contents of that database will be lost.

- Important to have a backup of your data to prevent accidental loss of info.
