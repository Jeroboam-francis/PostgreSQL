# Distinct

- For removing duplicates from your query.

Lets select country_of_birth from person, and apply some sorting.

> SELECT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth;

- You will see a list of countries starting from A - Z.

### How to know the unique countries that you have in your table.

That means you will see each country once.

Use the command:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT actual_column_name;
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;
```
