# NULLIF

How to tackle division by zero. 

- In programming, if you try to perform a division by zero, it will throw an error which is similar with postgres.

```sql
postgres=# SELECT 10 / 0;
ERROR:  division by zero
```

To tackle this, we use a special keyword.

## NULLIF

- It takes 2 arguments.
- It returns the first argument if the second argument is not equal to the first argument. 

```sql
test=# SELECT NULLIF(10, 10);
 nullif
 ```
       //Return null(no value.)
 - If the second argument is same as the first argument, the query result will be `null`.

 ```sql
 test=# SELECT NULLIF(10, 1);
 nullif
--------
     10 //Return the first value which is 10.
```

and 
 

```sql
test=# SELECT NULLIF(100, 10);
 nullif
--------
    100 //Return the first value which is 100.
(1 row)
```

- else it will return the first value. 

What we can do with this is that, if we select 10 divided by null. 

```sql
test=# SELECT 10 / NULL;
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)
```
Postgres does not throw an error.

It means we can safely perform our division. 

```sql
test=# SELECT 10 / NULLIF(2, 5);
 ?column?
----------
        5
(1 row)
```
- It will perform 10 divided by 2 and give a result of 5. 

If there is a division by 0, we don't want to throw an error. We simply want to return `null`.

```sql

test=# SELECT 10 / NULLIF(0,0);
 ?column?
----------

(1 row)

```

We can also use `COALESCE` to return 0 when working with a `null`.

```sql
test=# SELECT COALESCE (10 / NULLIF(0,0), 0);
 coalesce
----------
        0
(1 row)
```

It will result in 0 instead of `null`.

This is how we handle division by ZERO in postgres.
